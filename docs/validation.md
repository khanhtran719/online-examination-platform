# Validation log

Updated 2026-10-06. Scope: standards update and previously started TypeScript/domain/local dependency bootstrap. No application/AWS capacity claim is made.

| Check / command | Result | Detail |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Initial repository inspection | done | only AGENTS.md + .ai existed; no Git/source/project profile |
| RED domain `npm test` | expected fail | TS2307: Attempt/scoring source did not yet exist |
| RED tooling `node --test scripts/__tests__/quality.unit.spec.mjs` | expected fail | quality.mjs did not yet exist |
| GREEN `npm test` | passed | 18 domain cases across 2 Jest suites + 5 Node tooling cases; none skipped |
| `npm run typecheck` | passed | strict TypeScript check |
| `npm run build` | passed | compiles pure domain helpers; no API/worker runtime |
| `npm run lint` | passed | ESLint + quality command |
| `npm run quality` | passed | local Markdown links/anchors, project section IDs/context, literal source import boundaries, test placement |
| Prettier on source/config/tooling | applied | formats existing bootstrap; no product UI exists |
| `npm audit --audit-level=high` | exited 0 with findings | 0 high/critical; 20 moderate dev findings rooted in sprintf-js/Jest dependency chain; unresolved, no forced downgrade/override |
| `docker compose config --quiet` | passed | dependency-only Compose configuration |
| `docker compose ps` | passed | PostgreSQL healthy; ElasticMQ running; localhost-only bindings |
| `docker compose exec -T postgres psql ...` | passed | current DB/user query; PostgreSQL 17.11, aarch64 |
| Local `ListQueues` through Compose network | passed | scoring + scoring-dlq present |
| Application PostgreSQL/SQS integration | not run | UoW/repositories/schema/session/worker not implemented |
| Terraform/k6/application Docker/browser | not run | not implemented under narrowed scope |
| AWS deploy/load/failure/restore/cost | not run | no selected account/region/deployment/data |

Watchman on the host has a missing shared library; Jest explicitly uses `watchman:false`, and the actual test suites ran successfully. Initial unused runtime dependencies were removed; runtime security cannot be assessed before application dependencies are selected. The remaining dev dependency advisories are recorded, not treated as production security acceptance. No production secret was read or stored.

The checker does not prove dynamic runtime consistency, transaction atomicity, exported public capabilities or authorization. Alias import resolution is not yet configured; future aliases require extending checks/tests. Real integration/failure tests remain required in [contract test matrix](contract-tests.md).

Repository is not initialized as Git; no commit/branch/PR/diff review is claimed. Standards were self-reviewed for conflicting POS local policy, cursor contract, Nest-free Application examples, nested rollback-only semantics and truthful roadmap/evidence states. Local containers are stopped after checks, with data volume retained.
